    <h2 class="section" id="personal-profile"><span>Person Profile</span></h2>

    <p>With almost 4 years of software development experience, I would like to apply for a Fellow position to continue the work at CERN.</p>

    <p>I was recruited to CERN as PJAS in 2012 to the GS-AIS-EB (Electronic Business) section where I have had the chance to work on a few exciting projects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I successfully lead a few of my own projects: <b>Waiting List reservation</b> for CERN Hotel, which is used nowadays to process <b>more than 100</b> requests per day, and <b>DRC project</b> - CMS system based on Alfresco for DRSC office at CERN in order to replace existing solution based on SharePoint, where I went through the whole development process cycle;</li>
      <li><b>EDH</b> - Electronic Document Handling system in a team of 10 people. EDH is used all over CERN to decrease the bureaucracy and increase the efficiency. Here I had a big variety of tasks, from <b>3rd line support</b> to development of new documents/business processes.</li>
      <li><b>e-Personnel project</b> - CMS system based on Alfresco with more thanы 50 000 documents for recruitment unit at CERN;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>During my time at CERN I have had the opportunity to work with <b>different teams</b> (HR, CERN Hotel representatives, external consultants) as well as with different people in our section while implementing diverse projects together. Therefore, my focus is not only on my personal technical level improvement, but also on better understanding of business processes and needs of the whole team, and enhancing of communication skills.</p>
    <p>I spend a lot of time on <b>independent study</b>. During the last year, I launched the <b>technical blog</b> of mine, designed several widgets for open-source Linux window manager Awesome, deepened my knowledge of Java, Ruby, Python, RegEx.</p>

      <h4><em>September 2014 – Current</em></h4>
    </div>

    <p>I take part in the development of business critical <b>eFiles document management</b> system based on open source solution - Alfresco – the market leader in records management. One of my projects is <b>e-Personnel</b> – CMS system. I work in a small <b>team of three</b>; development is performed using agile software development with Scrum. As an Alfresco developer I work on extending and customizing Alfresco, which is needed since out of the box solutions of Alfresco do not provide enough functionality for CERN needs. Through this project, I have learned business processes of other teams, as we constantly work with CERN HR team, developing the way to link their needs with technical abilities of Alfresco software.</p>
    <p><strong>Selected Accomplishments</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Customization of server-side and client-side parts of Alfresco in correspondence to the organisation's internal processes and requirements.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Integrating Alfresco with AppDynamics - application performance management system. This project consisted of setting up the AppDynamics and development of the monitoring extensions in order to provide metrics.</p>
      </li>

    <p>I worked in GS-AIS-EB (Electronic Business) section for EDH (<b>Electronic Document Handling</b>) system, which covers many life aspects at CERN (such as absences, HR & Training, purchasing, logistics and safety). In this role, I was <b>developing EDH documents</b> and improving functionality of existing ones. I worked in a team of <b>8-10 people</b>; agile software development with Scrum was used for a development performance. One of the biggest and the most interesting project during this period was the development of CERN Hotel booking application. This activity included the work with Micros/Oracle consultant and Hotel’s representatives.</p>

      </li>
      <li>
