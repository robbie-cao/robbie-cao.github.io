**Software as a Service** is where you buy the service.  It offers little to no customization, 
but you don't have to worry about configuration or maintenance or updates or hardware other than 
your connectivity to the online service you’re purchasing. Examples are BPOS / Office365 and
Salesforce.com for business, or awesome consumer services like Zune Marketplace or XBOX Live. 

**Platform as a Service** is a solution for simply providing the application or data, and the 
rest of the platform is automatically maintained for you. So now I don't even have to worry about
the operating system or platform my application is running on. I build the application, define and 
create the storage structures, and upload it onto the platform.  I don't have to worry about
configuring load balancing or DNS.  The platform has clearly defined security practices already 
in place.  Upgrades to the platform are handled automatically.  I pay only for what I use, 
and I can spin-up or spin-down instances of computing power as needed, without interrupting 
the availability of my potentially globally accessible application.  The best example of PaaS 
I can think of is Windows Azure.  I’ll be covering Windows Azure in a later post in this series.

**Infrastructure as a Service** is the case when you're buying the space to manage your own 
infrastructure.  You don't have to worry about building servers or managing the virtualization
layers, but you provide or define the OS, the applications, data, and so on. 
Examples of IaaS are hosters that give you the ability to upload or create your own virtualized 
servers running on their hardware.  Another increasingly popular example is a "private cloud", 
where a large enterprise supplies computing resources company business units in a hosted, 
self-service, measured, elastic way.  (More about Private Clouds in a later post in the series).

## NaaS

Network as a service (NaaS) describes services for network transport connectivity. 
NaaS involves the optimization of resource allocations by considering network and 
computing resources as a unified whole.

## CaaS

Docker **Containers as a Service (CaaS)** - Achieve agility and control for Development and IT Operations teams to build, ship, and run any app, anywhere.
