Linus Torvalds funny qutoes from [WikiQuote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds).

- Talk is cheap. Show me the code.
- Hey, that's not a bug, that's a feature!
- Anybody who tells me I can't use a program because it's not open source, go suck on rms. I'm not interested. 99% of that I run tends to be open source, but that's my choice, dammit.
- Software is like sex; it's better when it's free.
- My name is Linus Torvalds and I am your god.
- Standards are paper. I use paper to wipe my butt every day. That's how much that paper is worth.
- Nobody actually creates perfect code the first time around, except me. But there's only one of me.
- Your code is shit.. your argument is shit.
- I like offending people, because I think people who get offended should be offended.
- Nvidia, fuck you!
- I wish everybody was as nice as I am.
