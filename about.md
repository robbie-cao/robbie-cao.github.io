# About

## ...this blog

Here I want to share some of my knowledge about Java related technolodgies, [Alfresco](http://www.alfresco.com/), databases, linux and so on.

This blog was made on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with modified [jekyll clean theme](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/jekyll-clean/) and [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) as a comments system. If you would like to use this theme for your blog please feel free to use/modify it. You can get it [here](https://github.com/streetturtle/jekyll-clean-dark).
