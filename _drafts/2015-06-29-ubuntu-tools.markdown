For the last half a year I reinstalled from the scratch my Ubuntu 4 times. Once because I moved from HDD to SSD, second time from SSD to the bigger one, and two other just for fun =) - to have a 'clean' installation. After each time I did it I needed to install all the software: IDEs, text redactors, some small tools and others programs. At some point I realized that it would be quite useful to have a .sh script which can do all this or at least have a list of tools/programs I usually use. So that next time I don't forget anything. Here I want to share these tools with some small explanation. Maybe you can find something useful for you :)
